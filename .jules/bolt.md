## 2025-01-31 - High Frequency Audio Updates Optimization

**Bottleneck:** `AudioPlayer` updates `currentTime` at 60Hz. This state was lifted to `TaskDetailPage` to coordinate `Waveform` and `TranscriptViewer`. This caused the entire `TaskDetailPage` and all children (ConfigPanel, Highlights, etc.) to re-render 60 times/second.

**Learning:** `React.memo` is critical when a parent component manages high-frequency state (like audio playback time) but passes it to children that don't need it or can compute derived state cheaply.

**Action:**
1. Memoized heavy static components (`ConfigPanel`, `HighlightList`, `DecupagemView`).
2. Decoupled `TranscriptViewer` from `currentTime` by calculating `activeSegmentIndex` in the parent and passing that stable value (which changes rarely) instead of the rapidly changing `currentTime`.

**Code:**
```typescript
// Parent calculates the stable index
const activeSegmentIndex = useMemo(() => {
    return findActiveSegmentIndex(segments, currentTime);
}, [segments, currentTime]);

// Child only updates when index changes
<TranscriptViewer activeSegmentIndex={activeSegmentIndex} ... />
```
