## 2025-02-18 - React Dropzone Accessibility

**UX Problem:** `react-dropzone` defaults to `role="presentation"` on the root element, making the drop zone invisible to screen reader users as an interactive button, even though it has `tabIndex={0}`.

**Learning:** Visual users see a "box" to click, but screen readers just see a focusable group with no role.

**Solution:** Explicitly pass `role: 'button'` and a descriptive `aria-label` to `getRootProps`.

**Pattern:** For `react-dropzone` usage in this app:
1. Pass `role: 'button'` to `getRootProps`.
2. Provide a clear `aria-label` describing the action (e.g., "Upload file").
3. Ensure status messages (uploading, error) have `role="status"` or `role="alert"`.

## 2025-02-24 - Search Results Keyboard Trap

**UX Problem:** Search results in `TranscriptViewer` were rendered as `div` elements with `onClick`. Keyboard users could search but not navigate or select results.

**Learning:** Interactive lists implemented as `div`s are invisible to keyboard navigation.

**Solution:** Converted `div`s to `<button>` elements with `type="button"`, `w-full`, and `text-left` to maintain layout while adding keyboard accessibility.

**Pattern:** For interactive list items:
1. Always use `<button type="button">`.
2. Use `w-full text-left` to mimic list item appearance.
3. Ensure focus styles (`focus-visible`) are present.
4. Avoid `div` with `onClick` unless implementing a custom widget with full ARIA roles (which is usually overkill).

## 2025-02-26 - Audio Player Sliders Accessibility

**UX Problem:** The Radix UI Slider (via shadcn/ui) has accessibility props (`aria-label`, `aria-valuetext`) on the Root element, but they are often forgotten when wrapping it, leaving screen reader users with just a "slider" role and a raw number (e.g., "50") without context (Volume? Progress? Seconds? Percent?).

**Learning:** `aria-valuetext` is crucial for sliders representing non-integer or unit-based values (time, percentage).

**Solution:** Added `aria-label` and `aria-valuetext` with formatted strings (`formatDuration`).

**Pattern:** For Sliders:
1. Always provide `aria-label` identifying the control.
2. If the value has units (seconds, percent), provide `aria-valuetext`.

## 2026-02-27 - WAI-ARIA disclosure and menu attributes
**UX Problem:** The toggle button for suggested titles in HighlightCard and the export menu dropdown in TranscriptViewer lacked the appropriate ARIA attributes.
**Learning:** Screen readers require these attributes to understand the state and the relationships between these elements.
**Solution:** Added `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` to the suggested titles toggle in `HighlightCard`, and `aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` to the export dropdown in `TranscriptViewer`. Additionally, added `role="menu"` to the dropdown container and `role="menuitem"` to its items.
**Pattern:** For this design system, interactive dropdowns and toggles that reveal additional content must always include the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes linking the button to the hidden container. Dropdown menus should implement the full WAI-ARIA menu structure.
## 2026-04-09 - Redundant Icon Announcements

**UX Problem:** Screen readers were announcing both the `aria-label` of icon-only buttons and the SVG elements inside them (e.g., 'Voltar 10 segundos, SkipBack'), causing redundant and confusing feedback.
**Learning:** SVG icons inside elements with an `aria-label` are still reachable by screen readers unless explicitly hidden, especially when using third-party icon libraries like `lucide-react` that may add default titles or roles.
**Solution:** Added `aria-hidden="true"` to all `lucide-react` icon elements inside icon-only buttons across the application (e.g., `AudioPlayer`, `ThemeToggle`, `CopyButton`).
**Pattern:** For this design system, ALL icon-only buttons must have:
1. A descriptive `aria-label` on the `<Button>` or `<button>` element.
2. `aria-hidden="true"` on the internal SVG/icon element to prevent redundant announcements.
