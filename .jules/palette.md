## 2025-02-18 - React Dropzone Accessibility

**UX Problem:** `react-dropzone` defaults to `role="presentation"` on the root element, making the drop zone invisible to screen reader users as an interactive button, even though it has `tabIndex={0}`.

**Learning:** Visual users see a "box" to click, but screen readers just see a focusable group with no role.

**Solution:** Explicitly pass `role: 'button'` and a descriptive `aria-label` to `getRootProps`.

**Pattern:** For `react-dropzone` usage in this app:
1. Pass `role: 'button'` to `getRootProps`.
2. Provide a clear `aria-label` describing the action (e.g., "Upload file").
3. Ensure status messages (uploading, error) have `role="status"` or `role="alert"`.

## 2025-02-24 - Search Results Keyboard Trap

**UX Problem:** Search results in `TranscriptViewer` were rendered as `div` elements with `onClick`. Keyboard users could search but not navigate or select results.

**Learning:** Interactive lists implemented as `div`s are invisible to keyboard navigation.

**Solution:** Converted `div`s to `<button>` elements with `type="button"`, `w-full`, and `text-left` to maintain layout while adding keyboard accessibility.

**Pattern:** For interactive list items:
1. Always use `<button type="button">`.
2. Use `w-full text-left` to mimic list item appearance.
3. Ensure focus styles (`focus-visible`) are present.
4. Avoid `div` with `onClick` unless implementing a custom widget with full ARIA roles (which is usually overkill).

## 2025-02-26 - Audio Player Sliders Accessibility

**UX Problem:** The Radix UI Slider (via shadcn/ui) has accessibility props (`aria-label`, `aria-valuetext`) on the Root element, but they are often forgotten when wrapping it, leaving screen reader users with just a "slider" role and a raw number (e.g., "50") without context (Volume? Progress? Seconds? Percent?).

**Learning:** `aria-valuetext` is crucial for sliders representing non-integer or unit-based values (time, percentage).

**Solution:** Added `aria-label` and `aria-valuetext` with formatted strings (`formatDuration`).

**Pattern:** For Sliders:
1. Always provide `aria-label` identifying the control.
2. If the value has units (seconds, percent), provide `aria-valuetext`.

## 2026-02-27 - WAI-ARIA disclosure and menu attributes
**UX Problem:** The toggle button for suggested titles in HighlightCard and the export menu dropdown in TranscriptViewer lacked the appropriate ARIA attributes.
**Learning:** Screen readers require these attributes to understand the state and the relationships between these elements.
**Solution:** Added `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` to the suggested titles toggle in `HighlightCard`, and `aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` to the export dropdown in `TranscriptViewer`. Additionally, added `role="menu"` to the dropdown container and `role="menuitem"` to its items.
**Pattern:** For this design system, interactive dropdowns and toggles that reveal additional content must always include the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes linking the button to the hidden container. Dropdown menus should implement the full WAI-ARIA menu structure.

## 2026-05-31 - TaskCard Delete Confirmation Dialog

**UX Problem:** The "Excluir projeto" (Delete project) button on the `TaskCard` triggered immediate deletion without any confirmation or feedback, violating the UX principle of making destructive actions reversible or confirmable.

**Learning:** Destructive actions without confirmation are frustrating. Implementing a custom confirmation dialog using the Radix UI `Dialog` primitives prevents accidental data loss and provides a consistent, accessible experience across the application.

**Solution:** Integrated the existing `Dialog` component from `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` into the `TaskCard` component. Added local state `isDeleteDialogOpen` to control visibility. Replaced the direct `removeTask` call on the trigger button with state toggle. Enhanced the trigger button with proper `aria-label` and `aria-hidden="true"` on the SVG icon.

**Pattern:** For this design system, ALL destructive actions must have:
1. A confirmation dialog (using `@/components/ui/dialog` primitives).
2. Proper ARIA attributes on the trigger button (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-hidden` on icons).
3. Clear explanations of the consequences inside the dialog description.
4. Appropriate button variants (e.g., `variant="destructive"` for the final confirm button).
