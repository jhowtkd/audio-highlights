## 2025-02-18 - React Dropzone Accessibility

**UX Problem:** `react-dropzone` defaults to `role="presentation"` on the root element, making the drop zone invisible to screen reader users as an interactive button, even though it has `tabIndex={0}`.

**Learning:** Visual users see a "box" to click, but screen readers just see a focusable group with no role.

**Solution:** Explicitly pass `role: 'button'` and a descriptive `aria-label` to `getRootProps`.

**Pattern:** For `react-dropzone` usage in this app:
1. Pass `role: 'button'` to `getRootProps`.
2. Provide a clear `aria-label` describing the action (e.g., "Upload file").
3. Ensure status messages (uploading, error) have `role="status"` or `role="alert"`.

## 2025-02-24 - Search Results Keyboard Trap

**UX Problem:** Search results in `TranscriptViewer` were rendered as `div` elements with `onClick`. Keyboard users could search but not navigate or select results.

**Learning:** Interactive lists implemented as `div`s are invisible to keyboard navigation.

**Solution:** Converted `div`s to `<button>` elements with `type="button"`, `w-full`, and `text-left` to maintain layout while adding keyboard accessibility.

**Pattern:** For interactive list items:
1. Always use `<button type="button">`.
2. Use `w-full text-left` to mimic list item appearance.
3. Ensure focus styles (`focus-visible`) are present.
4. Avoid `div` with `onClick` unless implementing a custom widget with full ARIA roles (which is usually overkill).

## 2025-02-26 - Audio Player Sliders Accessibility

**UX Problem:** The Radix UI Slider (via shadcn/ui) has accessibility props (`aria-label`, `aria-valuetext`) on the Root element, but they are often forgotten when wrapping it, leaving screen reader users with just a "slider" role and a raw number (e.g., "50") without context (Volume? Progress? Seconds? Percent?).

**Learning:** `aria-valuetext` is crucial for sliders representing non-integer or unit-based values (time, percentage).

**Solution:** Added `aria-label` and `aria-valuetext` with formatted strings (`formatDuration`).

**Pattern:** For Sliders:
1. Always provide `aria-label` identifying the control.
2. If the value has units (seconds, percent), provide `aria-valuetext`.

## 2026-02-27 - WAI-ARIA disclosure and menu attributes
**UX Problem:** The toggle button for suggested titles in HighlightCard and the export menu dropdown in TranscriptViewer lacked the appropriate ARIA attributes.
**Learning:** Screen readers require these attributes to understand the state and the relationships between these elements.
**Solution:** Added `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` to the suggested titles toggle in `HighlightCard`, and `aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls` to the export dropdown in `TranscriptViewer`. Additionally, added `role="menu"` to the dropdown container and `role="menuitem"` to its items.
**Pattern:** For this design system, interactive dropdowns and toggles that reveal additional content must always include the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes linking the button to the hidden container. Dropdown menus should implement the full WAI-ARIA menu structure.
## 2025-01-24 - Accessible Inline Tooltips for Info Icons

**UX Problem:** Inline info tooltips in the Cost Estimator used `<div>` elements and `group-hover:opacity-100` for visibility. This caused the tooltips to be completely inaccessible via keyboard navigation (could not receive focus) and invisible to screen readers since they lacked semantic meaning and ARIA associations.
**Learning:** Pure CSS hover tooltips built on `<div>` containers exclude keyboard and screen reader users from accessing contextual help text (like pricing breakdowns).
**Solution:** Converted the container to a `<button type="button">`, added `aria-describedby` pointing to the tooltip text (which received `role="tooltip"`), added a visually hidden label (`<span className="sr-only">`) for the button, and enabled focus visibility using `group-focus:opacity-100` and `focus-visible:ring-2`.
**Pattern:** For this design system, all custom inline tooltips without a robust library wrapper must use semantic `<button>` elements, manage visibility on both hover AND focus (`group-hover`, `group-focus`), provide a hidden label or `aria-label` for the icon, and link the tooltip text using `aria-describedby` and `role="tooltip"`.
