## 2025-02-18 - React Dropzone Accessibility

**UX Problem:** `react-dropzone` defaults to `role="presentation"` on the root element, making the drop zone invisible to screen reader users as an interactive button, even though it has `tabIndex={0}`.

**Learning:** Visual users see a "box" to click, but screen readers just see a focusable group with no role.

**Solution:** Explicitly pass `role: 'button'` and a descriptive `aria-label` to `getRootProps`.

**Pattern:** For `react-dropzone` usage in this app:
1. Pass `role: 'button'` to `getRootProps`.
2. Provide a clear `aria-label` describing the action (e.g., "Upload file").
3. Ensure status messages (uploading, error) have `role="status"` or `role="alert"`.

## 2025-02-24 - Search Results Keyboard Trap

**UX Problem:** Search results in `TranscriptViewer` were rendered as `div` elements with `onClick`. Keyboard users could search but not navigate or select results.

**Learning:** Interactive lists implemented as `div`s are invisible to keyboard navigation.

**Solution:** Converted `div`s to `<button>` elements with `type="button"`, `w-full`, and `text-left` to maintain layout while adding keyboard accessibility.

**Pattern:** For interactive list items:
1. Always use `<button type="button">`.
2. Use `w-full text-left` to mimic list item appearance.
3. Ensure focus styles (`focus-visible`) are present.
4. Avoid `div` with `onClick` unless implementing a custom widget with full ARIA roles (which is usually overkill).
